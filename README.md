# Process Scheduling Algorithms

This project was developed with Typescript, React and Material UI v5. It's part of my University Operating System course homeworks to understand how operating system works inside. There were several homeworks in that course regarding process scheduling, memory allocation and data storage management. The students were given partly developed python programm for the homeworks, however i decided to write my own web application for them. Here is the process scheduling part and the following algorightms - First Come First Serve, Shortest Job First, Round Robin and Two Way First Come First Serve. I hope you enjoy :)
